# Simple calculation of the quadratic equation

This script allows us to calculate the quadratic equation  of the form "a * x ** 2 + b * x + c = 0" easily.

# How to use

The script requires the installed Python interpreter version 3.5
on Linux/Unix/Windows:

Sample:
```bash
from quadratic_equation import get_roots


x1, x2 = get_roots(a=4, b=1, c=-1)
```

# How to Launch Tests
```bash
python3 tests.py
```
# Project objectives
